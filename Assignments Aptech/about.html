            Esports, short for electronic sports, refers to competitive video gaming. Unlike traditional sports, which are played in physical arenas, esports tournaments take place online or in specially designed gaming arenas. Esports athletes, also known as gamers, compete against each other in popular video games such as League of Legends and Overwatch.​
            While some may view esports as simply a hobby or pastime, it has evolved into a professional industry with millions of fans and significant financial investments. Esports tournaments offer large prize pools and attract major sponsors and advertisers. The growing popularity of esports has led to the development of professional teams and leagues, with players earning salaries and competing on a global stage.​
